What is Blazor?
#
The ASP.NET Team has created a new set of tooling called Blazor. It is a framework for client-side applications written in .NET, running under WebAssembly.

It is based on existing web technologies like HTML and CSS, but you use C# and Razor syntax instead of JavaScript to build composable web UI.
It gives all the benefits of a rich, modern single-page application (SPA) platform while using .NET end-to-end.
The idea about Blazor is to be able to combine Razor and C# into a client-side web project that runs completely in the browser.
WebAssembly
#
WebAssembly is a binary format for the code in the browser, and it runs much faster than traditional JavaScript. It gives the browser several advantages, such as:

Runs at near-native performance
Runs in a memory-safe, sandbox
It compiles from a range of languages, i.e., .NET, C, C++, Java, Rust, etc.
The main advantage of WebAssembly is that it handles memory-rich jobs and multi-threading very well as compared to javascript.
